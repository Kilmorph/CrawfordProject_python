# Project 1

The most important part is Step 1, i.e. reading impoartant data (number of atoms, atomic coordinates) from the input file.

A great advantage of python is the numpy library, which provides mighty tools for scientific computation, especially for vectors, matrices and high-order tensors. In the Hartree-Fock part we will meet a typical example (density matrix element times eri, then sum), and a useful tool called einsum
